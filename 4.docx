AWS Ground Station service :- 
    * It is a fully managed service that lets you control satellite communications , process data and scale your operations without worrying about building or managing your own Ground stations infrastructure . 

    * Use case Ground Station :- 
        -> weather forcasting 
        -> surface imaging 
        -> communications 
        -> video broadcast 
    * To use Ground Stations :
        -> You schedule a contact (select satellite ,start time ,end time , and the ground location) . 
        -> Use the AWS Ground Station EC2 AMI to launch EC2 instances that will uplink and downlink data during the contract or recieve downlinked data in  an amazon s3 bucket. 


AWS Outposts ‚Äì Bringing AWS to Your Data Center üè¢‚òÅÔ∏è
    * AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, services, and tools to on-premises data centers or co-location facilities.

    * It allows businesses to run AWS services locally in their own data centers while still being connected to the AWS cloud for hybrid cloud computing.

    * AWS Outposts is a rack of servers running AWS infrastructure on your physical location .

    * Why Use AWS Outposts?
        üîπ For workloads requiring low latency (e.g., real-time processing in factories, hospitals, or financial services).
        üîπ For data residency requirements (e.g., government, banking, and healthcare industries that must keep data within a country).
        üîπ For hybrid cloud environments (businesses that want to mix on-premises and cloud computing).

    * How AWS Outposts Works
        1Ô∏è‚É£ AWS delivers pre-configured hardware racks to your data center.
        2Ô∏è‚É£ You install and connect Outposts to your network.
        3Ô∏è‚É£ AWS remotely manages and updates it as part of your AWS infrastructure.
        4Ô∏è‚É£ You can run AWS services locally while still integrating with AWS Regions when needed.

    * What is Server Rack  , its all types and dimension : - 
        * Server Rack : a frame design to hold IT equipments . 
        * Rack Height :-    
            @ U stands for rack Units or "U spaces" which is equal to  1.75 inch . 
        * So a typical industry standart Server Rack is 48U (7 feet high) .
        * Common full size rack cage is 42U 

    * So a AWS Outposts comes in three form Factors :- 42U , 2U ,1U 
    
Common AWS Terminologies :- 
    1Ô∏è‚É£ High Availability ‚Üí Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

            * High Availability (HA) means ensuring that applications remain accessible even if some components fail.
            * AWS Solution: Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distributes traffic across multiple instances in different Availability Zones (AZs) to prevent downtime.

    2Ô∏è‚É£ High Scalability ‚Üí Vertical & Horizontal Scaling

            * Scalability refers to the ability to handle increasing workloads.
            * Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up/Down): Increasing instance size (e.g., upgrading from t2.medium to m5.large).
            * Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out/In): Adding or removing multiple instances to distribute the load.
            * AWS Solution: Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancer, EC2 Instance Types.
    3Ô∏è‚É£ High Elasticity ‚Üí Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

            * Elasticity means the ability to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.
            * AWS Solution: Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on CPU usage, traffic, etc.
    4Ô∏è‚É£ High Fault Tolerance ‚Üí RDS Multi-AZ

            * Fault Tolerance ensures that systems continue running even if a failure occurs.
            * AWS Solution: RDS Multi-AZ keeps a standby database in a different AZ that automatically takes over in case of failure.
            * Other fault-tolerant services: Route 53 Failover Routing, EC2 Auto Recovery, and S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR).

5Ô∏è‚É£ High Durability ‚Üí CloudEndure Disaster Recovery

            * Durability ensures data is not lost over time, even in extreme failures.
            * CloudEndure Disaster Recovery :continuously replicates your machine into a low cost staging area in your target aws account and preferred location enabling fast and reliable recovery in case of IT data centers failure .
