1.What is cloud computing : 

* Practice of using the network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store , manage , process data , rather than local server or a PC . 

* Cloud computing is a model where businesses and individuals can use computing resources (like servers, databases, and storage) over the internet without owning or managing the physical infrastructure

* In cloud Computing : 
    1. someone else own the servers 
    2. someone else Hires the IT people 
    3. someone else pays the rent on real state 
    4. You are responsible for your configuring  clous services and  code , someone else take care of the rest . 

 
2.Evolution of cloud hosting  ? 

    1.Dedicated Server (Traditional Hosting) – The Early Days
        * A physical server exclusively assigned to one business or user.
        * High performance but expensive.
        * Not easily scalable—if traffic increases, you need to buy more servers.

    2. Virtual Private Server (VPS) – The First Step Toward Virtualization 
        * A single physical server is partitioned into multiple virtual servers using virtualization technology.
        * Each VPS acts like a mini-dedicated server with its own resources but shares the physical machine.
        * More affordable than a dedicated server
        * More scalable than dedicated servers.
        * If one VPS consumes too many resources, others on the same machine may experience performance issues.
    
    3. Shared Hosting – The Budget-Friendly Option
        * A single physical server is shared among multiple users.
        * Resources (CPU, RAM, bandwidth) are distributed among different websites.
        * Best suited for small websites and blogs.
        * Performance issues if one site consumes too many resources.

    4. Cloud Hosting – The Modern Solution 
        * Instead of relying on a single physical server, cloud hosting uses multiple servers (a cloud infrastructure) working together.
        * If one server fails, another takes over (high availability).
        * Dynamically scales resources based on demand.
        * Scalable – Resources can be increased or decreased instantly.
        * Reliable – No single point of failure.
        * Pay-as-you-go pricing – Only pay for what you use.
